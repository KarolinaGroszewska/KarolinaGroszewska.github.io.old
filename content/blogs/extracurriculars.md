Welcome back everyone (or welcome if you're new)! For the last few days, I've had the chance to go and chat with some of the students at my high school about opportunities that are available in college (and beyond). These little introspectives and writing out the cool stuff I have gotten to do got me thinking a bit about what opportunities I took, which ones I failed to take, and which ones felt like the end of the world when I didn't get, but it ended up working out. So working back through high school, let's chat for a bit about what I've done, whether it was worth it, and whether I would suggest it to myself again!

Do keep in mind, a lot of things, especially the college application process, has changed since I applied to schools in 2019. That being said, I strongly suggest taking everything I say as personal experience and not a bible to success. A lot of various things work for various people, but this is for me â€“ and hopefully it helps you!
