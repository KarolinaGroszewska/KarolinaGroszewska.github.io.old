## Hello!

It has been a really long time since I have gotten the chance to sit down and write a bit about my experiences. To be completely honest, I had the most difficult things in my life all coalesce together into one really excruciating period of time, and it took me a long time to recover. 

Coming to you from right after winter break, I am here to provide some tips and tricks for surviving the tech world when it sometimes feels like you're not welcome in it. 

### Find like-minded people
A great community of individuals from different backgrounds, interests, or skills that I cared about  were able to provide me a lot of comfort and solace during the difficult times. Their aid included professional advice (pushing me to apply to opportunities I didn't believe I was going to get, or helping me prep technically), serving as resources (offering to attend an event with me I was not super sold on attending myself, or listening to my pros and cons when I had difficult choices to make), and even aiding in self–care (going out to coffee, cooking a meal together, or providing me two rides to the airport because I forgot to grab my passport – thank you again). These people made any challenge I was dealing with significantly easier, and they were often found in the most unlikely of places. 

### Keep learning
When you feel defeated, it is hard to keep yourself pushing for more when even what seems to be the minimum is hard to achieve. As an externally-driven person, I helped myself by using my learning opportunities as ways to interact with others. Structured plans to help work on a project made me feel better as I got ready, walked to the location (even if that was my desk), and got the chance to chat with others. Finding someone who keeps you accountable in your learning through a group application or a study buddy is a great way to stay motivated in your goals. Sometimes writing out my goals is helpful too, as long as I can stay motivated enough to update the writing logs as I need to. 

### Take care of everything else
Confidence is internal, and taking care of your body, mind, and health is important in keeping you sharp. I made sure to schedule time with my workout group for dinners or workout sessions, made sure to maintain meetings with my medical team, and sought more professional help when I needed it. These resources really allowed me to push forth and feel more powerful when I approached new tasks.
