Hi! If you're reading this, you probably know who I am. If you don't, well then you're in a great place to learn and I would suggest hitting my name in the top left corner. That will give you at least a decent professional insight.

I tend to be pretty bubbly, so this blog is gonna do that justice. If that's not your style, there's plently of places elsewhere that I'm sure will hit a similar niche. I wanted a place to talk about my professional insights in a way that is easily digestible and accessible, because I know pretty well that tech has a lot of hurdles people need to jump through to find their space.

## So... the website

I've wanted to have a digital portfolio of sorts since high school, but I wasn't comfortable with web development at that point, nowhere real it. It honestly took this summer and my intern project + Angular work to really get confident enough to jump into something like this. I've also always struggled with imposter syndrome in tech and it took years (no, really) of building confidence in my skills to be proud enough to display myself using the tools of the trade. I even attempted a website around this time last year, but struggled with hosting and not starting from completely scratch; but now I'm hosted and you can read this!

I took some time to look for inspirations and or templates I could utilize to make this shine. At my job we have recently stressed the downsides of reinventing the wheel, and while I could take a couple months to learn how to do this completely by myself, I am a pretty busy gal and I have other projects crying for my attention. Still, I wanted to utilize this desire I had suddenly gathered to make a website for good. I had worked with Hugo for my research project so when I found the template I knew it was a solid fit because I could tweak the config file with text pretty easily as I gain experience, and pop more stuff into the template when I get the chance. I spent the next two days tweaking around with the specs and making it my own. I wanted to make something that was my style (which did mean it was gonna be pretty dark) but also would feature my face because I adore that picture.

But now I get a space to talk about technology and development and the tech spaces I belong to and what I've gotten a chance to do (and will get a chance to do) so please join me for the ride! I am planning to talk about my experience attending GHC in-person, how I became part of a hackathon, and projects I have picked up along the way (as accountability measures). See you on my next post, hopefully!!
