## My Qualms with Resumes

Generally, I have always struggled with the idea of "selling myself" through a one-page PDF document in size 11 Times New Roman font. In high school I had a terrible time with college applications and supplements because I couldn't bring myself to talk well about my accomplishments. They were things I was doing because I liked the other people I was working with, the type of work I was doing, rather than really talking about it. To me, having to write what at the time seemed like humblebraggy text just did not sit right with me. 

It took a while for me to accept that writing a good resume and being able to promote yourself well is just a part of looking for a career/opportunity. It is also as an important of a recruitment skill as acing your behaviorals or polishing those technicals. So the purpose of this is to talk through first how to gain confidence to write about yourself and then how to actually do it well.

## Writing Confidence

### Your Career Center

One of the best things I did my first semester in college was attending a resume review session with a career coach specifically for my major. He helped me talk through what experience from high school was still worth keeping on my resume, how to format my resume well, and general things you should have on your resume while in college (GPA, Majors, Classes I've taken). I removed a lot of my high school experience because of the feedback which helped as I picked up more and more skills in college.

### Peer Review Sessions

Relying on your peers is one of the best things you can do, especially if those peers are your seniors themselves and have gone through enough iterations of their own resumes. The best one I ever attended was with two VandyHacks members (now alumns) who had sent me the template I still use. They had helped me write actual concise descriptions for the now overly beefy resume I had. I decided to now as organization President to run another session for the members since mine was really invaluable, and the people who got to attend so far had a great experience overall. If you're not in tech spaces that would organize something like this, I would suggest in general making upperclassmen friends and kindly asking. I know now as a junior I wouldn't say no to a resume review if someone asked.

### Building, Then Knowing Your Stregths

I had a lot of things I did, and really struggled about selling a consistent image in my resume. I was interested in recruiting for front-end roles, but my resume mostly showed leadership experience and high school mobile development projects. So I got involved in more events where I could do some front-end developments, sometimes successfully, and sometimes less so. My first 2 React projects I was mostly there to dig around the code and see if anyone needed something done that was easy enough for me to do. But then through more projects (especially my internship this year) I finally managed to actually gain enough experience to feel confident enough to work on apps on my own. Now, I can spend 2 hours building out a React Native title screen and combining my passions! In general, if you are looking for a specific growth opportunity, build skills that will let you gain that specific opportunity. 

## The Nitty Gritty

This sections is about the actual specifics - wording, templates, etc.

### ATS Friendly Resumes

Your best bet for this is going to be finding an ATS-friendly template, filling it out, and then running it through an ATS resume reader to see what and how it spits information out. My template is from a friend and I have no idea where they got it from, but googling will yield some fantastic templates and also ATS readers. If you care about privacy (which you should) make sure you replace relevant information with gibberish so your phone number doesn't end up somewhere you don't want it to.

### Free Resources

If you are a GHC attendee or you upload your resume to the free GHC database, you will be able to receive a free resume review from TopResume. They will harrass your email with writing ads after, but the advice they provide is relevant enough that the packages they give for paid writing should be avoided. After all, no one should know your accomplishments better than you.

### Achievement vs. Task-based Writing

Make sure you know how the projects you've worked on or the internships you've done impact people. Try to quantify everything you can in terms of impact you had on people, efficiency, accessibility, etc. Make sure you use numbers. Talk about what tech stacks you know and used too!

## Some Final Thoughts

If you ever need a resume review, feel free to reach out! I can set aside ~30 minutes to sit with you and talk about your experiences and figure out things with you. Thanks for reading! Up next, I'll write about something else. Don't know what that will be yet - but I am having a blast with these.
