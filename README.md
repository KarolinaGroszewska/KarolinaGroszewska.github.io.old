This is (finally) my personal website! It's an extended resume that also includes occassional blog posts about what I find important to discuss as a college junior, woman in tech, and anything else I happen to be.

Upcoming blog post ideas include:
- How to best prepare for a new semester
- How to create meaningful personal projects
- Why diversity in tech matters
- My experience attending GHC 2022 :D
- Semester project/life updates
