With back to school steadily approaching (and many of us already moving) it is as valuable of a time as any to discuss what I do to prepare for a new semester and academic year. I want to take some time to discuss what I find important to do consistently, how I best manage my time in a stressful-ish back to school season, and how to prepare for not just academic aspects of heading back to school.

## Looking back

An important part of my preparation for this semester has involved looking at the previous semesters to gauge what aspects of my life did and didn't work for me. Whether personal or academic, I took inventory of elements that didn't pan out exactly how I wanted (like my Programming Languages final) and tried to narrow it down to weaknesses and pain points. To be honest, I always start off each semester overly ambitious in terms of "I am going to dedicate X hours of studying every week for this class, and I am going to read the textbook before and after each class"...and I keep it up for maybe 3 weeks until the classes, the extracurriculars, and the time management gets too hard. So when I make goals for the new year, I try to also consider what goals I made previously and why those failed.

## Deciding on goals for this year

Once my classes are sorted I sit down and take a look at my approximate schedule. Within that, I make sure to take inventory of all strange blocks of time that may affect my schedule once I am aware of them. My biggest definining blocks during the semester are: 
- The actual scheduled time of my classes
- Weekly meetings for extracurriculars
- Exercise times and time to get to and from them
- One-off unique events that are more than 24 hours long
I place all of these into my calendar as soon as they are available so that I can plan accordingly. I then sit down and work around whatever other necessary events I will need to incorporate - interview preparation and practice, studying for exams, homework, or even cooking my meals and getting groceries. I am very much a planner so I like to sit down at some point on Sunday and take a look at the week ahead, to get in the best habit. For school, I do this a little earlier to get more of an idea as to what I need to account for. This semester all of my classes end at noon so it makes little sense for me to plan things in the morning when 9am classes 5x a week already terrify me.
